- The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space generated by its columns, which is given by the number of linearly independent columns (or rows) in a given matrix. It can be proven that the number of independent columns (known as column rank) is always equal to the number of independent rows (called row rank). Hence, for a matrix A with m rows and n columns (represented as A_mn)
